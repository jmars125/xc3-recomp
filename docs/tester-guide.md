# Tester guide: running XC3 Recomp on your GPU

This guide is for testing the build on a GPU other than the developer's (AMD RX 9070). You build it from source with
your own copy of the game and your own console keys. Nothing from the game is in this repository, and nothing you build
from it may be shared.

## What you need

- Windows 10 or later, an x86-64 CPU with AVX2, about 60 GB free.
- A GPU with Vulkan 1.3 and `VK_EXT_external_memory_host`, with a current driver.
- *Xenoblade Chronicles 3* base game (1.0.0) and the 2.0.0 update (plus the optional add-on content), dumped from your own Switch as NSP or XCI.
- `prod.keys` dumped from your own Switch. Never send it to anyone, and never paste it into a log or an issue.

## Build

1. Follow [building.md](building.md): the toolchain, then build steps 1-6 (Python environments, `config.local.toml`
   with your own paths, extraction, the shader translator, lifting and linking, shader preparation). The result is
   `build\<ver>\xc3.exe`, with `<ver>` the game version you built (`v143` or `v121`).
2. Check the build without the game: `build\<ver>\xc3.exe --selftest` must print a pass.
3. To run the build on another of your machines, package a portable folder ([building.md](building.md), "Portable
   folder"). The folder holds game code: for your own machines only.
4. The installer ([installer.md](installer.md)) is the other route to a machine without the toolchain: it builds the
   game there from your own files. No installer release is published yet.

## Run and collect the log

Every run writes its log to `logs\xc3.log` next to `xc3.exe`; the four runs before it are kept as `xc3.1.log` to
`xc3.4.log`, and Open log folder in the settings menu's Advanced tab (F1) shows them. Copy the log before you start the
game again. A file stops at 64 MiB. Started with `2> file`, the game writes its log to that file instead.

From `cmd.exe` in the repository root, with the validation layer on:

```bat
set XC3_VK_VALIDATION=1
build\<ver>\xc3.exe
```

`XC3_VK_VALIDATION=1` turns on the Vulkan validation layer (it comes with the Vulkan SDK). It makes the game slower;
do one run with it and one without (`set XC3_VK_VALIDATION=`).

Keep the window in the foreground: an unfocused window stalls the game. Shaders the preparation did not cover compile on first use, so
the first minutes of play can stutter.
Play into the open field (load a save, walk around for a minute, fight something if you can), then close the window.

## Choosing the GPU

A laptop with an iGPU and a discrete GPU, or two cards, lists every GPU at the top of the log (`vk: gpu 0: ...`).

- `set XC3_GPU_NAME=Radeon` picks the first usable GPU whose name contains that text (case does not matter).
- `set XC3_GPU_INDEX=1` picks GPU 1 from that list.

The line `vk: using gpu N: <name>` says which one ran.

## What to send back

1. `logs\xc3.log` from each run. It contains no keys and no game files. The lines that matter most start with
   `vk caps:` (GPU, driver, features and the fallbacks taken), `vk: gpu`, `validation` and `gfx_shader:`.
2. GPU model, driver version, CPU, RAM, and whether it is a laptop. Copy system info in the settings menu's Advanced
   tab (F1) puts these and your changed settings on the clipboard. Say which game update you ran.
3. What you saw: how far it got (menu, loading, field), roughly how smooth it ran, and screenshots of anything wrong
   (black or missing areas, flickering, wrong colours, missing grass). Win+Shift+S is fine.
4. If it crashed or hung: what you were doing. The log of that run ends with the crash report, so send it whole.
5. For a bug you can trigger again: a recording of your input (`set XC3_INPUT_RECORD=input.txt`, see
   [controls.md](controls.md), "Scripted input") and the save you started from.

## Steam Deck

Build or install on Linux ([installer.md](installer.md), "Linux release"), in Desktop Mode. The game then runs in either
mode; for Game Mode, add `xc3` from the install folder to Steam as a non-Steam game.

The game recognises the Deck (LCD and OLED) and uses its device profile for every setting `xc3.ini` does not set:
fullscreen, game resolution 1280x720 letterboxed in the 1280x800 screen, the game's own 3D scale, vsync and a 30 fps
limit. These are starting points, not measurements. What helps most:

1. The performance overlay (F10, or both stick clicks L3 + R3) in full mode: the frame rate, mean and longest frame
   time over a minute in a colony, in open country and in a battle, with the settings named.
2. The same with `fps_limit` 30 and 60 and `render_scale` 50, 67 and game, so the defaults can be picked from
   measurements. Steam's own performance overlay (the ... button) adds power draw and temperatures.
3. LCD or OLED, SteamOS version (`uname -r` in Desktop Mode's terminal), and the game update.
4. Anything that looks stretched or cut off: the game draws 16:9 only, so the profile keeps black bars above and
   below; `picture_fit = stretch` fills the screen instead.

`device_profile = desktop` in `xc3.ini` turns the profile off; `deck` turns it on elsewhere, to try the Deck's
settings on a PC.

## Switches for the developer's questions

Only set these when asked; each forces a fallback the build picks by itself on GPUs that need it.

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `XC3_VK_NO_FLOAT64=1` | Translate shaders without 64-bit floats |
| `XC3_VK_SSBO_ALIGN=64` | Treat storage buffers as needing 64-byte alignment |
| `XC3_VK_SUBGROUP_PIN=0` | Do not pin shaders to 32 lanes; tell the translator the GPU's own subgroup size |

Each switch makes the first launch translate every shader again.
